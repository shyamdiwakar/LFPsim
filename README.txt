/*LFPsim - Simulation scripts to compute Local Field Potentials (LFP) from cable compartmental models of neurons and networks implemented in NEURON simulation environment.

LFPsim works reliably on biophysically detailed multi-compartmental neurons with some or all active channels.

README for LFPsim
=================

1. Copy all LFPsim files and the directory into your NEURON model directory downloaded from ModelDb. Copy lfp.mod and mea.mod from LFPsim to the mechanism directory of the NEURON model.

2. Compile the model; if you had already compiled the model without LFPsim, include the LFPsim mod files and re-compile using "nrnivmodl" or "mknrndll".

3. Load your neuron or network model in NEURON.  

4. On the terminal type: xopen("extracellular_electrode.hoc") to initiate LFPsim GUI interface.

5. Set the electrode properties in the GUI. 

6. Run the simulation to reconstruct LFP.

A detailed step-by-step procedure is also listed in the How-To-LFPsim.pdf document.
